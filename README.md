# [NDSS 2024] NODLINK: An Online System for Fine-Grained APT Attack Detection and Investigation
This is an implementation of NodLink and the public Simulated datasets described in NDSS 2024 paper: [NODLINK: An Online System for Fine-Grained APT Attack Detection and Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02331).
## Simulated-Data
We carried out 5 attacks on three different hosts. The attack description and annotation are listed in the _doc_ folder.

### Simulate on Ubuntu
We carried out an attack on Ubuntu 20.04.

## NodLink
The prototype of NodLink is in the `src` directory. The `README.md` in it describes how to run our tool.

## ProvDetector
The prototype of our reimplementation of ProvDetector that is described in paper [You Are What You Do: Hunting Stealthy Malware via Data Provenance Analysis](https://kangkookjee.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/provdetector-ndss2020.pdf).
